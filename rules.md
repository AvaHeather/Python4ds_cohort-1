# Rules of the Nairobi Master Python for Data Science Cohorts

## Main Commitment
### *You will dedicate at least 4 hours each week to cover the weekly material.*

**Start Date**
21st January 2019

## Additional Rules
1. Show proof of work done by commiting to your logs and sharing code that you've written and or through blog posts that will be published on Medium or on the community Slack Channel(The Mode may vary on a weekly basis)
2. Push code to GitHub at least weekly so that anyone can see your progress
3. Update the Log(log.md) with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see your progress.

## Ideas to make this more effective
1. To increase the chances of success, it's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](https://github.com/Python-4-DS/Cohort-1/blob/master/log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post.
2. If you get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd)
3. Another good bonus of forking this repo -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.
